 <h2>About RVA in a Day!</h2>
 <p>Our purpose is simple. We want to make your visit to Richmond as easy as possible. We know how frustrating 
 it can be to visit a city while not knowing where to go or what to do.  We have mapped out and planned a day
 of fun just for you!</p>
 <h2>Who is our site for?</h2>
 <p>Being the capitol of Virginia and strategically located on the east coast, Richmond has become a rapidly growing
 city centered around banking and government.  With companies such as Capitol One, Amazon, Dominion, and Altria, young
 professionals have flocked to RVA over the last decade.  New businesses, restaurants, and shops have spread throughout
 the city to cater to young couples, singles, and college graduates.  While our itineraries are focused on the 
 activities enjoyed by these young people, we encourage everyone to take a look at what we have planned!</p>  
 <h2>How else is this site useful?</h2>
 <p>Within our itineraries we have many external links to various activities around Richmond.  Simply browser through the itineraries 
 and take note of places that interest you and you will be able to easily create your own itinerary!</p>
